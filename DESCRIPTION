Description: It allows to rapidly compute, bootstrap and plot up to fourth-order Sobol'-based sensitivity indices using several state-of-the-art first and total-order estimators. Sobol' indices can be computed either for models that yield a scalar as a model output or for systems of differential equations. The package also provides a suit of benchmark tests functions and several options to obtain publication-ready figures of the model output uncertainty and sensitivity-related analysis. An overview of Sobol'-based sensitivity indices can be found in Saltelli et al. (2008, ISBN:9780470059975) and in Puy, Lo Piano, Saltelli, and Levin (2021) <arXiv:2101.10103>.
