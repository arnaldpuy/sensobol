\title{sensobol: Computation of Variance-Based Sensitivity Indices}
\description{
It allows to rapidly compute, bootstrap and plot up to third-order Sobol'-based sensitivity
indices using several state-of-the-art first and total-order estimators. Sobol' indices
can be computed either for models that yield a scalar as a model output or for systems of
differential equations. The package also provides a suit of benchmark tests functions
and several options to obtain publication-ready figures of the model output uncertainty
and sensitivity-related analysis.
