\usage{
sobol_matrices(
  matrices = c("A", "B", "AB"),
  N,
  params,
  order = "first",
  type = "QRN",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrices}{Vector with the required matrices. The default
is \code{matrices = c("A", "B", "AB")}.}

\item{N}{Positive integer, initial sample size of the base sample matrix.}

\item{params}{Character vector with the name of the model inputs.}

\item{order}{One of "first", "second" or "third" to create a matrix to
compute first, second or up to third-order Sobol indices. The default is
\code{order = "first"}.}

\item{type}{Approach to construct the sample matrix. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{type = "QRN"} (default): It uses \insertCite{Sobol1967;textual}{sensobol} Quasi-Random Numbers.
through a call to the function \code{\link{sobol}} of the \code{randtoolbox} package.
\item \code{type = "LHS"}: It uses a Latin Hypercube Sampling Design
\insertCite{McKay1979}{sensobol} through a call
to the function \code{\link{randomLHS}} of the \code{lhs} package.
\item \code{type = "R"}: It uses random numbers.
}}

\item{...}{Further arguments in \code{\link{sobol}}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix where each column is a model input distributed in (0,1) and each row
a sampling point.
}
\description{
It creates the sample matrices to compute Sobol' first and total-order indices.
If needed, it also creates the sample matrices required to compute second and
third-order indices.
}
\details{
Before calling \code{sobol_matrices}, the user must decide which estimators
will be used to compute first and total-order indices, for this option conditions
the design of the sample matrix and therefore the argument \code{matrices}.
See the vignette for further details on the specific sampling designs required by
the estimators.

The user can select one of the following sampling designs:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\mathbf{A}}, \eqn{\mathbf{B}}, \eqn{\mathbf{A}_B^{(i)}}.
\item \eqn{\mathbf{A}}, \eqn{\mathbf{B}}, \eqn{\mathbf{B}_A^{(i)}}.
\item \eqn{\mathbf{A}}, \eqn{\mathbf{B}}, \eqn{\mathbf{A}_B^{(i)}}, \eqn{\mathbf{B}_A^{(i)}}.
}

If \code{order = "first"}, the function creates an \eqn{(N, 2k)} matrix according to the approach defined by
\code{type}, where the leftmost and the rightmost \eqn{k} columns are respectively allocated
to the \eqn{\mathbf{A}} and the \eqn{\mathbf{B}} matrix. Depending on the sampling design, it
also creates \eqn{k} \eqn{\mathbf{A}_B^{(i)}} (\eqn{\mathbf{B}_A^{(i)}}) matrices, where all
columns come from \eqn{\mathbf{A}} (\eqn{\mathbf{B}}) except the \eqn{i}-th, which comes from
\eqn{\mathbf{B}} (\eqn{\mathbf{A}}). All matrices are returned row-binded.

If \code{order = "second"}, \eqn{\frac{k!}{2!(k-2)!}} extra \eqn{(N, k)} \eqn{\mathbf{A}_B^{(ij)}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{B}_A^{(ij)}}) matrices are created, where all columns come from \eqn{\mathbf{A}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{B}}) except the \eqn{i}-th and \eqn{j}-th, which come from \eqn{\mathbf{B}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{A}}). These matrices allow the computation of second-order effects, and are row-bound
to those created for first and total-order indices.

If \code{order = "third"}, \eqn{\frac{k!}{3!(k-3)!}} extra \eqn{(N, k)} \eqn{\mathbf{A}_B^{(ijl)}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{B}_A^{(ijl)}}) matrices are bound below those created
for the computation of second-order effects. In these matrices, all columns come from \eqn{\mathbf{A}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{B}}) except the \eqn{i}-th, the \eqn{j}-th and the \eqn{l}-th, which come from \eqn{\mathbf{B}}
(\eqn{\mathbf{A}}). These matrices are needed to compute third-order effects, and are row-bound below
those created for second-order effects.

All columns are distributed in (0,1). If the uncertainty in some parameter(s) is better described with
another distribution, the user should apply the required quantile inverse transformation to the column of
interest once the sample matrix is produced.

# Define settings
N <- 100; params <- paste("X", 1:10, sep = ""); order <-  "third"

# Create sample matrix using Sobol' Quasi Random Numbers.
mat <- sobol_matrices(N = N, params = params, order = order)

# Let's assume that the uncertainty in X3 is better described
# with a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1:
mat[, 3] <- qnorm(mat[, 3], 0, 1)
