@article{Jansen1999,
abstract = {A scalar model output Y is assumed to depend deterministically on a set of stochastically independent input vectors of different dimensions. The composition of the variance of Y is considered; variance components of particular relevance for uncertainty analysis are identified. Several analysis of variance designs for estimation of these variance components are discussed. Classical normal-model theory can suggest optimal designs. The designs can be implemented with various sampling methods: ordinary random sampling, latin hypercube sampling and scrambled quasi-random sampling. Some combinations of design and sampling method are compared in two small-scale numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{KhorashadiZadeh2017,
abstract = {Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is an essential technique to support the calibration of environmental models by identifying the influential parameters (screening) and ranking them. In this paper, the widely-used variance-based method (Sobol') and the recently proposed moment-independent PAWN method for GSA are applied to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and compared in terms of ranking and screening results of 26 SWAT parameters. In order to set a threshold for parameter screening, we propose the use of a “dummy parameter”, which has no influence on the model output. The sensitivity index of the dummy parameter is calculated from sampled data, without changing the model equations. We find that Sobol' and PAWN identify the same 12 influential parameters but rank them differently, and discuss how this result may be related to the limitations of the Sobol' method when the output distribution is asymmetric.},
