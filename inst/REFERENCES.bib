abstract = {A scalar model output Y is assumed to depend deterministically on a set of stochastically independent input vectors of different dimensions. The composition of the variance of Y is considered; variance components of particular relevance for uncertainty analysis are identified. Several analysis of variance designs for estimation of these variance components are discussed. Classical normal-model theory can suggest optimal designs. The designs can be implemented with various sampling methods: ordinary random sampling, latin hypercube sampling and scrambled quasi-random sampling. Some combinations of design and sampling method are compared in two small-scale numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f (X1, X2, ..., Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is an essential technique to support the calibration of environmental models by identifying the influential parameters (screening) and ranking them. In this paper, the widely-used variance-based method (Sobol') and the recently proposed moment-independent PAWN method for GSA are applied to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and compared in terms of ranking and screening results of 26 SWAT parameters. In order to set a threshold for parameter screening, we propose the use of a “dummy parameter”, which has no influence on the model output. The sensitivity index of the dummy parameter is calculated from sampled data, without changing the model equations. We find that Sobol' and PAWN identify the same 12 influential parameters but rank them differently, and discuss how this result may be related to the limitations of the Sobol' method when the output distribution is asymmetric.},

@article{Oakley2004,
abstract = {Summary. In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework which unifies the various tools of prob- abilistic sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be computed from a single set of runs.},

abstract = {Many mathematical models involve input parameters, which are not precisely known. Global sensitivity analysis aims to identify the parameters whose uncertainty has the largest impact on the variability of a quantity of interest (output of the model). One of the statistical tools used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the output is the Sobol sensitivity index. We consider the statistical estimation of this index from a finite sample of model outputs: we present two estimators and state a central limit theorem for each. We show that one of these estimators has an optimal asymptotic variance. We also generalize our results to the case where the true output is not observable, and is replaced by a noisy version.},

@article{Homma1996,
abstract = {The present paper deals with a new method of global sensitivity analysis of nonlinear models. This is based on a measure of importance to calculate the fractional contribution of the input parameters to the variance of the model prediction. Measures of importance in sensitivity analysis have been suggested by several authors, whose work is reviewed in this article. More emphasis is given to the developments of sensitivity indices by the Russian mathematician I.M. Sobol'. Given that Sobol' treatment of the measure of importance is the most general, his formalism is employed throughout this paper where conceptual and computational improvements of the method are presented. The computational novelty of this study is the introduction of the 'total effect' parameter index. This index provides a measure of the total effect of a given parameter, including all the possible synergetic terms between that parameter and all the others. Rank transformation of the data is also introduced in order to increase the reproducibility of the method. These methods are tested on a few analytical and computer models. The main conclusion of this work is the identification of a sensitivity analysis methodology which is both flexible, accurate and informative, and which can be achieved at reasonable computational cost.

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis helps decision-makers to understand how a given model output responds when there is variation in the model inputs. One of the most authoritative measures in global sensitivity analysis is the Sobol' total-order index ({\$}T{\_}i{\$}), which can be computed with several different estimators. Although previous comparisons exist, it is hard to know which estimator performs best since the results are contingent on several benchmark settings: the sampling method ({\$}\backslashtau{\$}), the distribution of the model inputs ({\$}\backslashphi{\$}), the number of model runs ({\$}N{\_}t{\$}), the test function or model ({\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}) and its dimensionality ({\$}k{\$}), the weight of higher order effects (e.g. second, third, {\$}k{\_}2,k{\_}3{\$}), or the performance measure selected ({\$}\backslashdelta{\$}). Here we break these limitations and simultaneously assess all total-order estimators in an eight-dimension hypercube where {\$}(\backslashtau, \backslashphi, N{\_}t, \backslashvarepsilon, k, k{\_}2, k{\_}3, \backslashdelta){\$} are treated as random parameters. This design allows to create an unprecedentedly large range of benchmark scenarios. Our results indicate that, in general, the preferred estimator should be Razavi and Gupta's, followed by that of Jansen, or Janon/Monod. The remainder lag significantly behind in performance. Our work helps analysts navigate the myriad of total-order formulae by effectively eliminating the uncertainty in the selection of the best estimator.},

abstract = {Comparison studies of global sensitivity analysis (GSA) approaches are limited in that they are performed on a single model or a small set of test functions, with a limited set of sample sizes and dimensionalities. This work introduces a flexible ‘metafunction' framework to benchmarking which randomly generates test problems of varying dimensionality and functional form using random combinations of plausible basis functions, and a range of sample sizes. The metafunction is tuned to mimic the characteristics of real models, in terms of the type of model response and the proportion of active model inputs. To demonstrate the framework, a comprehensive comparison of ten GSA approaches is performed in the screening setting, considering functions with up to 100 dimensions and up to 1000 model runs. The methods examined range from recent metamodelling approaches to elementary effects and Monte Carlo estimators of the Sobol' total effect index. The results give a comparison in unprecedented depth, and show that on average and in the setting investigated, Monte Carlo estimators, particularly the VARS estimator, outperform metamodels. Indicatively, metamodels become competitive at around 10–20 runs per model input, but at lower ratios sampling-based approaches are more effective as a screening tool.},
